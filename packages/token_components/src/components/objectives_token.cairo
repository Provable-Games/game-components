//! Objectives Token Component
//!
//! This component extends the CoreTokenComponent by adding objectives tracking.
//! It implements both IMinigameToken and IObjectivesToken interfaces.
//!
//! Use this component when you need basic token functionality + objectives tracking.

// NOTE: For this exercise, we'll focus on the architectural demonstration
// This would contain similar structure to MinterTokenComponent but with objectives features

pub mod ObjectivesTokenComponent {
    // Placeholder - in practice this would be a full implementation
    // similar to MinterTokenComponent but with objectives functionality
