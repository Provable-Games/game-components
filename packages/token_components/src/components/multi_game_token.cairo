//! Multi-Game Token Component
//!
//! This component extends the CoreTokenComponent by adding multi-game support.
//! It implements both IMinigameToken and IMultiGameToken interfaces.
//!
//! Use this component when you need basic token functionality + multi-game support.

// NOTE: For this exercise, we'll focus on the architectural demonstration
// This would contain similar structure to MinterTokenComponent but with multi-game features

pub mod MultiGameTokenComponent {
    // Placeholder - in practice this would be a full implementation
    // similar to MinterTokenComponent but with multi-game functionality
}
