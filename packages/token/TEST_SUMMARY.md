# Token Extension Tests Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have implemented comprehensive tests for all token extensions in the game-components token package. The tests are located in `/workspace/game-components/packages/test_starknet/src/token/`.

## Test Structure

### 1. Mock Contract (`token_starknet_mock.cairo`)
- A comprehensive mock that implements the token contract with all extensions
- Configurable extension support via initialization parameters
- Implements all required interfaces and components

### 2. Core Token Tests (`test_token.cairo`)
- Basic minting functionality
- Lifecycle management (start/end times)
- Playability checks
- Game state updates
- Multiple update tracking
- Token details retrieval
- Interface support verification
- Edge cases (updating before start, after end)

### 3. Multi-Game Extension Tests (`test_multi_game.cairo`)
- Game registration from valid contracts
- Game ID and address bidirectional mapping
- Multiple game registration
- Creator token minting
- Token-to-game address tracking
- Client URL storage
- Interface validation (requires IMinigame)
- Duplicate registration prevention

### 4. Objectives Extension Tests (`test_objectives.cairo`)
- Objective storage during minting
- Objective count and retrieval
- Objective ID tracking
- Multiple tokens with different objectives
- Objective order preservation
- All objectives completed check
- Integration with token updates
- Event emission testing

### 5. Minter Extension Tests (`test_minter.cairo`)
- Minter ID assignment and tracking
- Multiple minters with unique IDs
- Minter ID reuse for same address
- Consistency across multiple tokens
- Cross-game minter tracking
- Behavior without extension enabled

### 6. Soulbound Extension Tests (`test_soulbound.cairo`)
- Soulbound token creation
- Transfer prevention for soulbound tokens
- Non-soulbound token transfers work
- Approval mechanism (still prevents transfer)
- Mixed soulbound/transferable tokens
- Burn functionality
- Behavior without extension enabled

## Key Testing Patterns

1. **Interface Support**: Each extension test verifies SRC5 interface support
2. **Edge Cases**: Tests cover boundary conditions and error scenarios
3. **Integration**: Tests verify extensions work together properly
4. **Configuration**: Mock allows testing with different extension combinations
5. **Event Testing**: Structure supports event verification (with snforge spying)

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following commands from the workspace root:

```bash
# Build the test package
scarb build -p game_components_test_starknet

# Run all token tests
cd packages/test_starknet && snforge test token

# Run specific test module
cd packages/test_starknet && snforge test test_multi_game

# Run with verbose output
cd packages/test_starknet && snforge test -v
```

## Test Coverage

The tests cover:
- ✅ All public functions in each extension
- ✅ State management and storage
- ✅ Error conditions and panics
- ✅ Integration between extensions
- ✅ Interface detection and support
- ✅ Event emission (structure in place)
- ✅ Edge cases and boundary conditions

## Notes

1. The tests use `snforge_std` for testing utilities like `start_cheat_caller_address`
2. Event verification can be enhanced with snforge's event spying features
3. The mock contract allows flexible testing of different extension combinations
4. Tests are isolated and can run independently
