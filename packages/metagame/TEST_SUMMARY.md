# Test File Fix Summary

## Files Fixed
I have successfully fixed all the unit test files in `/workspace/game-components/packages/metagame/tests/unit/` as requested:

### 1. test_minting.cairo
- ✅ Removed `use starknet::testing;` import
- ✅ Removed `assert_eq` from snforge_std imports
- ✅ Replaced all `assert_eq(a, b, "message")` with `assert(a == b, 'message')`
- ✅ All 8 assert statements now use the correct format with single quotes

### 2. test_context.cairo
- ✅ Removed `use starknet::testing;` import
- ✅ Removed `assert_eq` from snforge_std imports  
- ✅ Replaced all `assert_eq(a, b, "message")` with `assert(a == b, 'message')`
- ✅ All 5 assert statements now use the correct format with single quotes
- ✅ Removed all `.into()` calls from string literals (25 occurrences)

### 3. test_game_registration.cairo
- ✅ Removed `use starknet::testing;` import
- ✅ Removed `assert_eq` from snforge_std imports
- ✅ No assert_eq calls were present in this file (already correct)

## Changes Applied
All files now follow the same patterns as `test_initialization.cairo`:

1. **Import fixes:**
   - Removed `use starknet::testing;`
   - Removed `assert_eq` from snforge_std imports

2. **Assertion fixes:**
   - All `assert_eq(a, b, "message")` → `assert(a == b, 'message')`
   - Single quotes used for error messages
   - Messages are short enough for felt252

3. **String literal fixes:**
   - All `.into()` calls removed from string literals
   - Plain strings used directly

## Current Status
The unit test files have been successfully updated. However, there are compilation errors in the mock contracts that prevent the tests from running. These errors are not related to the unit test files I was asked to fix, but rather to issues in:

- `tests/common/mocks/mock_metagame_contract.cairo`
- `tests/common/mocks/mock_context.cairo`
- `tests/common/mocks/mock_token.cairo`

The mock contracts have interface compatibility issues that would need to be addressed separately to make the tests runnable.

## Files Successfully Fixed
- `/workspace/game-components/packages/metagame/tests/unit/test_minting.cairo`
- `/workspace/game-components/packages/metagame/tests/unit/test_context.cairo`
- `/workspace/game-components/packages/metagame/tests/unit/test_game_registration.cairo`

All requested changes have been applied according to the patterns shown in `test_initialization.cairo`.
